Robot Escape Room Project
=======
Description
To entertain DSU students, we need a short but engaging escape room puzzle that is thought-provoking and interactive but with a clear objective because most DSU students found those elements of puzzles the most appealing according to our interview research. Our escape room consist of three robots with one being the controller bot and the other two acting as enemies. The goal of the excape room is to collect three colered keys while trying to not get caught by an enemy bot in order to win the game and get the fastest time.
