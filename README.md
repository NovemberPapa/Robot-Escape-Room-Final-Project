# Description:
# You are a Tomb Raider looking to make your next big shot at fame. Bills are stacking high, your whole life you have been a Tomb Raider with no real money or fame. As you scroll online you see that the tomb of the Famous Swamp Sage "Jar Jar" has been discovered. However, he was a trap specialist in his time. No one dares to go near it but you. This is your big shot at fame, your Magnum Opus moment the peak of your life. You go in and doors shut behind you, as you walk further and further you enter a large room and the door shuts behind you! The walls start rising! However, this is no ordinary maze...You see shadowy figures roaming around. Will you escape this tomb or become part of it? 
# Objective:
# Our escape room consists of three robots. One is remote-controlled by the player(you). The other two act as enemies. The goal of the escape room is to collect three colored keys(R.G.B) as you navigate through the maze. While trying not to get caught and killed by enemy bots. To win the game you must collect all three keys and escape. There is also a leaderboard for the fastest time to build competitiveness.
